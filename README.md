## Checklist
- [X] The game must have first-person exploration at all times. (See the above GIF). Exceptions are point to point overworld map movement (fast travel), combat screens, cut scenes, town screen, inventory screen other relevant screens. -->
- [X] The game must have explorable locations. It doesn't have to be a dungeon in the traditional sense. It can be urban environments, outdoors, spaceship interiors, planetary surfaces etc. (depending on the jam theme). Whichever environment the game has it must be viewed and explored in first-person. -->
- [X] The game must feature step movement on a square grid (no hexagons, octagons, etc.). Smooth transitions between grid squares are allowed. Half-steps or dividing a logical grid square into smaller squares are NOT accepted. The size of a square should equal the size of the wall segments it is connected to. Consider a grid square as a cube with a ground, four walls, and a ceiling. Enemies must also move on the same grid as the player.
- [X] The game must feature 90-degree turns in the four cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. Smooth transitions between 90-degree angles are allowed. Turning must be invoked by keyboard (or gamepad) control. Mouse-look is permitted as a temporary way to look around, but it should snap to 90 degrees when not in use. Games that allow 90-degree turns up and down are also acceptable.
- [X] The game must have a player controlled character (or party of characters), or the abstraction of a character or persona.
- [X] The game must at the very least have some basic stats. (Minimum a single health/power bar)
- [X] The game must have a win condition.
- [X] The game must have a death/perish/fail condition, or some other end-of-game mechanic. Roguelite mechanics where you restart game upon death but retain some progress is allowed.
- [X] The game must have at least one way to affect character stat(s). Examples are resting, potions, items with bonuses, food, water, powerups etc.
- [X] The game must have combat or a similar mechanic for determining outcome of certain situations, enemy encounters and events.
- [X] The game must include a clearly visible interpretation of at least one of the four themes. Only entries with a clear and visible theme interpretation will be eligible for ranking and prizes.
- [X] Your game must not contain nudity, hateful language or visuals. Please consider avoiding extremely strong language and excessive gore, as the games in this jam should be suitable for a general audience. Failure to do so may result in disqualification.
